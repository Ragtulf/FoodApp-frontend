## How we did it

We spent a lot of time planning. We visualized everything we could in Figma before we started coding. We decided early on to break the project down to features that could focus on one at a time and be sure our product was interesting to a user early on. Then we built on top of that from our list of features we had planned. We ended up realizing a lot of our strech-goals. We really enjoyed this project and we'll continue with it and build more features.
